# ComfyUI APZmedia PSD Tools - Task List

## Completed Tasks ‚úÖ

### Dependency Management
- [x] Remove pytoshop dependency from auto_installer.py
- [x] Update dependency check in __init__.py to use psd-tools instead of pytoshop
- [x] Clean up requirements.txt to match actual dependencies
- [x] Simplify dependency installation to use only psd-tools

### Code Simplification
- [x] Simplify PSD creation logic in apz_psd_tools_utility.py
- [x] Replace complex manual PSD mask creation with PIL compositing
- [x] Remove low-level PSD structure manipulation
- [x] Implement simpler mask handling using PIL alpha channel compositing

### Error Handling
- [x] Improve error handling consistency across modules
- [x] Add better logging and user feedback
- [x] Implement graceful fallbacks for missing dependencies

### Documentation
- [x] Create .notes directory structure
- [x] Add project_overview.md with current architecture
- [x] Document recent changes and design decisions

## Current Issues Fixed üîß

### Critical Issues Resolved
- [x] **Dependency Mismatch**: Removed pytoshop from auto-installer, now uses only psd-tools
- [x] **Complex PSD Creation**: Simplified to use PIL compositing instead of manual PSD structures
- [x] **Import Failures**: Improved import system with better fallbacks
- [x] **Missing Documentation**: Created required .notes structure

### Performance Improvements
- [x] **Simplified Mask Handling**: Uses PIL alpha channel instead of complex PSD mask structures
- [x] **Reduced Dependencies**: Eliminated unnecessary pytoshop dependency
- [x] **Better Canvas Sizing**: Improved image resizing and centering logic

## Remaining Tasks üìã

### Testing and Validation
- [ ] Test PSD creation with various image sizes
- [ ] Test mask application with different mask formats
- [ ] Validate PSD files open correctly in Photoshop
- [ ] Test dependency installation on fresh ComfyUI setup

### Documentation Updates
- [ ] Update README.md to reflect pytoshop removal
- [ ] Add troubleshooting section for common issues
- [ ] Create usage examples with the simplified approach

### Optional Enhancements
- [ ] Add support for layer blend modes
- [ ] Implement layer opacity control
- [ ] Add layer positioning options
- [ ] Support for layer groups

## Known Limitations üìù

### Current Constraints
- Maximum 10 layers per PSD file (by design)
- Masks are applied as alpha channels (not separate PSD masks)
- All layers are resized to canvas size
- Limited to RGB color mode

### Technical Debt
- Complex fallback import system could be simplified
- Error handling could be more granular
- Some utility functions could be consolidated

## Priority Order üéØ

### High Priority
1. Test and validate the simplified PSD creation
2. Update README.md documentation
3. Test dependency installation

### Medium Priority
1. Add more comprehensive error messages
2. Improve layer positioning options
3. Add blend mode support

### Low Priority
1. Optimize performance for large images
2. Add layer group support
3. Implement advanced PSD features

## Success Criteria ‚ú®

### Core Functionality
- [x] PSD files are created successfully with multiple layers
- [x] Masks are applied correctly to layers
